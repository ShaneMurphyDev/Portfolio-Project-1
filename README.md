<h1>Kingdom Cats</h1>
Kingdom Cats is a website for adopting and fostering cats and kittens that need a home. I choose this because it's something i'm passionate about. The goal to create an easy to use and easy to understand website for those interested in adoption. Kingdom Cats will be ideal for people living in Co Kerry and include a gallery with adoptees, information about them, abd all of our contact information incase they decide to adopt.

<h2>Testing</2>
I have conducted thourough testing via the browser inspect and dev tools. This includes test the site on different screen sizes such as phones, tablets, laptops, and so on. Im very happy with how well everything works. Ran nito some issues with the adopt page images lining up and sizing correctly. After much experimentation im happy with the way it ended up.

Unfixed bugs - There is are bug where the text ajoining a gallery image doesnt stay together, i've tried recreating it to understand whats happening and i believe it's due to the seperation of divs
